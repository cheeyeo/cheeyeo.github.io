This post is a review of my current experience of using Gemini CLI for software development. One of the key skills as a software developer in 2026 is to be ready for working alongside a foundational model such as Gemini. I have seen countless posts and job specs asking for ability to work, create and review code generated by a foundational model known as **vibe coding**.

My understanding of **vibe coding** as a concept is that we provide the model with a list of features and requirements as context and allow the model to autogenerate the entire project for you. In my use case, I'm interested to see how this applies to current projects that have already been developed. 

I use one of my current personal project as a testbed, a simple FastAPI application to upload image files to S3. It has a single API endpoint **/upload/s3** and I have been testing all the upload via the Swagger UI Docs. I have the current features which I want to delegate to Gemini CLI to handle:

* Create a React UI frontend to handle file uploads to the API
* Run basic linting and formatting using ruff

Before all the above, we need to install the Gemini CLI and set it up first.
